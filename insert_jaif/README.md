Script for inserting type annotations provided in a jaif file into a class file. For a test run:

    python jaif_into_class.py

This first downloads the
[http://types.cs.washington.edu/annotation-file-utilities/#annotation-file-utilities-description](annotation-utils) and runs one test where it merges jaif annotations into a class file. Look at the source code for details.

More will come soon.
