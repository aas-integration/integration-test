/**
 * This class represents a cone collision shape centered at the origin and aligned with the Y axis. The cone is defined
 * by its height and by the radius of its base. The center of the cone is at the half of the height. The "transform" of
 * the corresponding rigid body gives an orientation and a position to the cone. This collision shape uses an extra
 * margin distance around it for collision detection purpose. The default margin is 4cm (if your units are meters, which
 * is recommended). In case, you want to simulate small objects (smaller than the margin distance), you might want to
 * reduce the margin by specifying your own margin distance using the "margin" parameter in the constructor of the cone
 * shape. Otherwise, it is recommended to use the default margin distance by not using the "margin" parameter in the
 * constructor.
