ODE4J
=====

ode4j is a Java port of [ODE](http://www.ode.org/).

ODE is an open source, high performance library for simulating rigid body dynamics. It is fully featured, stable, mature and platform independent with an easy to use C/C++ API. It has advanced joint types and integrated collision detection with friction. ODE is useful for simulating vehicles, objects in virtual reality environments and virtual creatures.
It is currently used in many computer games, 3D authoring tools and simulation tools.

The latest version of ode4j is 0.3.0.
Version 0.2.4 up to 0.2.9 are ports of ODE 0.12.1, Version 0.3.0 is a port of ODE 0.13.1

ode4j contains also some features that are not present in ODE, such as a ragdoll and heightfields with holes. See [Wiki](https://github.com/tzaeschke/ode4j/wiki/Functionality-beyond-ODE).

The [ODE forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ode-users) is useful for questions around physics and general API usage: 

The [ode4j forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/ode4j) is for problems and functionality specific to ode4j/Java.
