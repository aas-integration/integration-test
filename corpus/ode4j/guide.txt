REAL(i) not required.

dxBody, dxJoint methods have all been moved into their respective classes.
But they will continue to be available via a static API. (?)

dBodyID: The 'ID' part is removed since we are always dealing with
	actual objects.

All dXXXID classes: They have been removed, there are only the dXXX and
dxXXX classes left.

All d... classes have been renamed to D... .

TODO
- in OdeMath rather than A.v[1] use v2 = A.getV() or implement A.get11()
